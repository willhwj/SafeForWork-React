I tried it at my class presentation by changing smart ass to engineer (nothing against engineer, just that the class topic is on engineering creaticity, so i wanted to crack some jokes), and everyone was enjoying it. most say it's witty. but some find it a bit rude, but acceptable. so i guess it depends on how you used and the audience's tolerance level. good one indeed."

Even though there were 2 umbrellas in the room and he knew he needed 2 umbrellas, he decided to only bring 1, just in case someone else might need the other umbrella.
